langgraph_engine.state — GovernanceState for LangGraph

One graph run = one workitem.
State carries only that workitem's data through the graph.

GovernanceState fields:
- project_id: str — project this workitem belongs to
- task_id: str — the workitem being processed
- workitem: WorkItem | None — the workitem object (loaded from StateStore)
- task_state: TaskState | None — current task state
- pending_handoffs: list[Handoff] — active handoffs
- gates: dict[str, Gate] — gate decisions (gate_id -> Gate)
- event_log: list[Event] — events emitted during this graph run
- current_action: str — command from last node: advance | block | handoff | halt | gate_approved | gate_rejected | done
- halt_reason: str | None — set when current_action = "halt"
- blocked: bool — whether task is currently blocked
- blocker: str | None — description of blocker if blocked
