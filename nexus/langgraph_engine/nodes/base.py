langgraph_engine.nodes.base — Base node function pattern

Every node follows this contract:
- Receives GovernanceState
- Performs one bounded action within its role scope
- Returns a command dict (not a modified state directly)
- Does NOT own governance judgment
- Does NOT make routing decisions

Routing is handled by LangGraph's conditional edges based on current_action.
