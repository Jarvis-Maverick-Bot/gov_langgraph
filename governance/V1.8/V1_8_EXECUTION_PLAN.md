**Duration:** 2 days
**Exit gate:** Game completable via CLI without error

#### Tasks

**Task 1.1 — Grid data model** (F1.1.1, F1.1.3)
- Define grid as N×M 2D array
- Cell type enum: WALL, OPEN, START, EXIT, AGENT
- Grid seed → deterministic generation
- BFS path verification per grid

**DoD:**
- [ ] Grid class accepts width, height, seed; produces identical cells on repeated instantiation with same seed
- [ ] CellType enum has all 5 types; cell_at() returns WALL for out-of-bounds coordinates
- [ ] BFS compute_optimal_path() returns ≥ 0 for each starter grid; returns -1 for unsolvable grid

**Verification:** `python -m pytest grid_escape/tests/test_pathfinding.py -v` passes

**Task 1.2 — Grid rendering** (F1.1.3, F2.1.1)
- ASCII renderer outputting `#/.S/E/A/*`
- `look` command returns current grid state
- Agent position reflected as `A` after first move

**DoD:**
- [ ] `look` command outputs ASCII grid matching grid dimensions
- [ ] Agent visible as `A` at current position after any move
- [ ] All cell types render as correct symbols (#, ., S, E, A)

**Verification:** Manual `echo 'look' | python grid_escape.py --grid ge-001` outputs valid grid

**Task 1.3 — Movement engine** (F1.1.3, F2.1.4, F2.2.2, F2.2.5)
- `move <dir>` with direction aliases (n/north, s/south, e/east, w/west)
- Boundary and wall collision → `BLOCKED`
- State update: agent position, visited trail
- Step counter increment

**DoD:**
- [ ] All 8 direction aliases (north/n, south/s, east/e, west/w and full names) are accepted
- [ ] Move into WALL or out-of-bounds returns `BLOCKED` with no state change
- [ ] Valid move updates agent_pos, increments step_count, appends to visited
- [ ] `python -m pytest grid_escape/tests/test_movement.py -v` passes

**Verification:** `echo -e 'move north\nmove south' | python grid_escape.py --grid ge-001` shows BLOCKED for wall collision

**Task 1.4 — Game commands** (F2.1.1–F2.1.4, F2.2.1–F2.2.5)
- `look` → full grid render
- `move <dir>` → move or error
- `status` → step count + state + position
- `restart` → grid reset, step reset
- `quit` → final output, session end

**DoD:**
- [ ] All 5 commands (`look`, `move`, `status`, `restart`, `quit`) are recognized
- [ ] Unknown command returns `UNKNOWN COMMAND` (not crash)
- [ ] `restart` resets agent_pos to start and step_count to 0
- [ ] `quit` outputs final step count and exits cleanly

**Verification:** `echo -e 'status\nrestart\nstatus' | python grid_escape.py --grid ge-001` shows 0 steps after restart

**Task 1.5 — Completion detection** (F1.1.2, F1.1.4, F2.2.4)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Agent reaching EXIT tile outputs exactly one `ESCAPED|<steps>|<grid_id>|<timestamp>` line
- [ ] After ESCAPED, subsequent moves output no state changes
- [ ] ESCAPED line contains all 4 pipe-separated fields, timestamp is ISO format

**Verification:** `python -m pytest grid_escape/tests/test_completion.py -v` passes

**Task 1.6 — Scoring tiers** (F1.1.4)
- Optimal path pre-computed at grid generation (BFS from S to E)
- Tier assignment: PERFECT / EXCELLENT / GOOD / COMPLETED / OVERMOVED
- Output tier on completion line

**DoD:**
- [ ] Optimal path stored per grid at generation time (BFS verified)
- [ ] Tier computed as: diff≤0 → PERFECT, diff≤2 → EXCELLENT, diff≤5 → GOOD, diff≤10 → COMPLETED, else → OVERMOVED
- [ ] Tier displayed in completion output

**Verification:** `python -m pytest grid_escape/tests/test_scoring.py -v` passes with known optimal values

- ge-002: 8×8, optimal 12 steps, verified solvable
- ge-003: 10×10, optimal 18 steps, verified solvable
- Grid seed stored per grid for deterministic replay

**DoD:**

- [ ] BFS confirms optimal steps match spec (8, 12, 18 respectively)
- [ ] Running same grid twice with same seed produces identical grid
- [ ] All 3 grids are completable (path exists from S to E)

**Verification:** `python grid_escape.py --grid ge-001 --seed 42 | head` runs without error; BFS test confirms solvability

- Queue/progress view for V1.8 delivery queue
- Artifact/review visibility surface

**DoD:**
- [ ] PMO UI accessible on port 8000 via `uvicorn governance_ui.main:app`
- [ ] `/workflow` route shows active delivery items with status
- [ ] `/queue` route shows V1.8 delivery queue
- [ ] `/artifacts` route shows artifact/review visibility

### Sprint M4-R3 — Real Claw ↔ Viper Handoff
**Functions:** F8.1.1–F8.3.3, F10.2.3
**Duration:** 1 day
**Exit gate:** Claw → Viper handoff exercised with real Grid Escape engineering work

**Acceptance standard — real handoff vs. pseudo-handoff:**

This sprint must prove a **real exercised operational handoff**, not a document-mediated pseudo-handoff.

| | Pseudo-handoff (insufficient) | Real operational handoff (required) |
|---|---|---|
| Handoff package | Defined and documented | Defined AND acknowledged by Viper side |
| Viper execution | Work acknowledged but not executed | Viper executes bounded work and returns real outputs |
| Return receipt | Document created but no real outputs | Real outputs (code, evidence, or documented results) returned across boundary |
| Evidence | Document alignment | Cross-team trace showing actual work crossing the delivery boundary |

F8.3.1 (exercise in actual work, not paper-only) and F8.3.3 (return path is real, not omitted) are the binding constraints. If both teams merely acknowledge documents without executing real work across the boundary, the sprint exit gate is not met.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Handoff package delivered to Viper side (documented channel/contact)
- [ ] Handoff ID assigned and logged
- [ ] Evidence: handoff package in `handoff/evidence/handoff_001.md`

**Verification:** `handoff/evidence/handoff_001.md` exists with complete handoff package

**Task 9.2 — Viper execution response** (F8.2.1–F8.2.3)
- Viper receives handoff
- Viper executes bounded engineering-enablement work
- Viper returns outputs/results across delivery boundary

**DoD:**
- [ ] Viper acknowledges receipt (timestamped acknowledgment, not just document existence)
- [ ] Viper executes bounded work within handoff scope — real engineering outputs produced
- [ ] Viper returns real outputs across the delivery boundary (code, evidence, or documented results)
- [ ] Return receipt created with: receipt_id, handoff_id, status, output summary
- [ ] No evidence of pseudo-handoff: handoff is acknowledged AND executed, not just documented

**Verification:** Return receipt exists in `handoff/evidence/return_receipt_001.md`; receipt shows real outputs, not just acknowledgment

**Task 9.3 — Handoff evidence capture** (F8.3.1–F8.3.3)
- Handoff package + Viper output + return receipt logged
- Return path confirmed
- Evidence doc: `V1_8_CLAW_VIPER_HANDOFF.md`

**DoD:**
- [ ] `V1_8_CLAW_VIPER_HANDOFF.md` exists in docs/
- [ ] Contains: handoff package ref, return receipt ref, evidence summary
- [ ] Return path confirmed (Claw Studio received Viper output)
- [ ] Both handoff and return receipt evidence linked

**Verification:** Sprint M4-R3 exit gate: `V1_8_CLAW_VIPER_HANDOFF.md` exists with complete handoff/return trace

**Sprint M4-R3 Exit Gate Verification:**
- [ ] Handoff package delivered to Viper side with documented delivery channel
- [ ] `handoff/evidence/handoff_001.md` exists with handoff package
- [ ] Viper acknowledges receipt with timestamped acknowledgment
- [ ] Viper returns **real outputs** (code, evidence, or documented results — not just acknowledgment)
- [ ] `handoff/evidence/return_receipt_001.md` exists and shows real outputs delivered
- [ ] `V1_8_CLAW_VIPER_HANDOFF.md` exists with both handoff and return receipt refs
- [ ] No pseudo-handoff: evidence shows actual cross-boundary work execution, not document alignment only

## 9. Out of Scope (Functions Explicitly Excluded)

**Correction from prior version:** F1.1.2 is correctly "Define the game objective and completion condition" (F1.1.2 is NOT about routing). The exclusion of AI-powered routing inference is a scope-level statement, not a Function ID. It maps to the scope document's out-of-scope list: "AI-powered routing inference as the primary routing mechanism."

The following are explicitly out of scope for V1.8:

| Excluded Item | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| AI-powered routing inference as primary routing mechanism | Explicitly ruled out in Foundation §6 — V1.8 uses deterministic rule lookup only |
| F4.x heavy UI features | UI must remain thin; heavy UI would block V1.8 closure |
| F7.4.3 instantiation of Architect/CodeReviewer/Security/Docs/DBExpert | F7.4.3 explicitly defines these as documented skill specs only (V1.9 targets); not excluded from scope, but not instantiated in V1.8 |
| F10.2.1 multi-game support | Portfolio operations belong to V1.9+ |
| Pub/Sub as generalized infrastructure | Formal Pub/Sub is V1.9 scope |
| Commercial launch/store/promotion | V2.0 territory |

---

## 10. Closure Test Reminder (from V1.8 Foundation §8)

V1.8 does not close unless all 10 questions below answer **yes** using real evidence:

1. Was a first real AI-native game delivered through the defined governed structure?
2. Is the delivered game materially agent-playable rather than only conceptually described?
3. Can at least one real Agent participant actually play and complete the game through the defined agent-facing interface?
4. Did Claw and Viper function together through a real handoff/execution path where needed?
5. Can all required PMO Smart Agent interaction scenarios be performed through CLI commands without depending on UI interaction?
6. Does the CLI also support the specific command set required for the first AI-native game itself?
7. Did PMO Event Routing successfully handle at least one real ownership/handling uncertainty case through a bounded routed-resolution loop?
8. Is UI dependency kept thin enough that the release is not blocked by heavy frontend buildout?
9. Are governance and PMO oversight still explicit at the right authority points?
10. Is the release strong enough to count as first-product proof without borrowing closure language from later versions?

Each sprint exit gate is designed to produce evidence directly addressable against these 10 questions.
