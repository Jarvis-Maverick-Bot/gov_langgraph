## V1 Standing Notes

These are acknowledged V1 shortcuts. They are recorded here so they do not silently harden into long-term doctrine.

### 1. DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID hardcoded
`DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID = "pmo-kickoff"` is a V1 hardcoded shortcut in `kickoff_task_tool`.

**Why it's acceptable for V1:** Single-project PMO use case makes this pragmatic.
**Why it's not doctrine:** Future multi-project PMO use requires this to be a configurable or user-supplied value.

**Acknowledged by:** Nova (2026-04-09 code review)

### 2. Evidence pending = gate_decision_note emptiness
"Evidence pending" display in the gate panel is triggered by `gate_decision_note` being empty.

**Why it's acceptable for V1:** True evidence presence tracking requires a separate evidence model. V1 uses the simplest workable proxy.
**Why it's not doctrine:** A proper evidence model would distinguish evidence presence from decision annotation. This simplification must not harden.

**Acknowledged by:** Nova (2026-04-09 Sprint 4 review)
