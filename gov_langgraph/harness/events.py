harness.events — Layer 3: Append-Only Event Journal

Append-only event journal for governance audit trail.
Records governance-relevant actions, changes, and conditions.

Layer 3 is NOT mutable state — events are append-only.
Layer 3 is for: audit, replay, provenance.

Governance meaning of events is owned by Platform Core Event object.
This module handles persistence only.
