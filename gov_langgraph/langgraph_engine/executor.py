langgraph_engine.executor — Agent Executor

Routes agent actions through the LangGraph pipeline.
Agent cannot bypass the pipeline — all actions go through stage nodes.

Nova decision (2026-04-06): LOCKED for V1.

Authority enforcement (3 layers, all mandatory):
  1. Pre-execution: is this role allowed to attempt this stage?
  2. Action-specific: is this exact action permitted for this role?
  3. Completion: did handoff satisfy governance?

Failure handling:
  - Authority failures (layers 1-2): ALWAYS propagate — no silent swallow
  - Event journal failure: silently contained (does not halt pipeline)
  - Handoff completeness failure: propagates as ValueError

Key separation:
  - initiator (state.actor): who initiated this pipeline run — tracked, not used for stage authority
  - executing role: the role-shaped agent's own role — used for authority checks
